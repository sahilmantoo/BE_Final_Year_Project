The main objective of this project is to find the best model to analyze the value of the stock market. In, this project we are going to present and review a more feasible method to analyze the stock movement with higher accuracy. The first thing we have taken into account is the dataset of the stock market prices from previous year. The dataset was pre-processed and tuned up for real time visualization using Highcharts. Our project will also focus on RPA Technology for data fetching of the stock data by which we will train our model, create live charts and do the prediction on a daily basis. The successful model for stock market will be a great asset for the stock market institutions and will provide real-life solutions to the problems that stock investors face. We will be using the ARIMA Algorithm for the forecasting.
